##article='''Monty Python (also collectively known as the Pythons) were a British surreal comedy group who created their sketch comedy show Monty Python\'s
##Flying Circus, which first aired on the BBC in 1969. Forty-five episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the television
##series into something larger in scope and impact, including touring stage shows, films, numerous albums, several books, and musicals. The Pythons\'
##influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles\' influence on music. Their sketch show has been referred to as \"not only one of the more enduring
##icons of 1970s British popular culture, but also an important moment in the evolution of television comedy\".'''
